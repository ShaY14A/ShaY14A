- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShaY14A, my name is Shaema
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Front End Web Development and Design 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student at the University of Toronto studying Communication Culture and Information Technology and Psychlogy 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email: Shaema.alaasmi@mail.utoronto.ca
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Communication Culture and Information Technology is a vague degree title I know, I basically study the impact of technology on society (both positive and negative) and study user behaviour and little of multimedia design, writing and communication, it makes me a jack of all trades, and maybe a master of nothing!
